# cummings lab members :fish:

This repository contains all sorts of useful information for new and current members of the [Cummings lab](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/cummingslab/).

# newbies
If you are new or starting in the lab, head over to the folder called new members or [click here](https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/tree/master/new-members). In the folder you'll find your first two tasks as new lab members: 

(1) [Complete the online modules required of IACUC (the animal welfare people) and EHS (and lab safety people).](https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/blob/master/new-members/tasks_to_complete.md)     
(2) [Hit the books.](https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/tree/master/new-members/readings) There are a couple book chapters and one review to introduce you to the lab. The book chapters are meant to introduce you to what sorts of questions the lab is interested in and how you might go able answering those questions. The review is a paper Molly wrote that's more specific to what we've done recently in the lab.

# current lab members
For the grizzled veterans, the [current members](https://github.com/lukereding/cummings_lab_members/tree/master/current-members) folder contains useful links and other documents that might come in handy.
